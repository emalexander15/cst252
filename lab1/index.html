	<h1>Lab 1 - Getting Started</h1>
	<br>
		<h2>Website 1: Gallery Scroll</h2>
			<a href="https://blindsight.space/memories/">Website 1</a>
	<br>
		<p>Under the Filters and Effects collection on awwwards.com I found
			the blur effect on spiral scroll. I thought this feature was neat
			and would work best with showcasing a gallery whether it be a portfolio
			for photography, graphic design, game design, or e-commerce. I found not
			only the scrolling effect to be eye-catching, but also the spiral effect
			and blurring before playing the video it lands on. I would guess a feature
			like this could be implemented through a css image feature with the blurring
			and scrolling, and the spiral to be an advanced css code possibly in Java.</p>

		<h2>Website 2: Transitional Typography and Logo</h2>
			<a href="https://www.femmefatale.paris/en/projects">Website 2</a>
	<br>
		<p>Under the Creative Portfolios collection on awwwards.com I found transitional
			typography and gif functions I thought were interactive and fun. The text fades
			into the page slowly as it loads and contrasts nicely with the dark background.
			The logo in the corner also has a scroll over feature blooming into a golden gif
			from the plain black and white monogram before. These features could make a simple
			webpage more exciting with a small paragraph of text like a biography or explaining
			the work you have published, and the logo in the corner is memorable. I believe
			the logo may have a css function going from a plain png to a gif with a scroll function
			as well as the type fading into the page through a text css function as I recall an image
			fade code we learned about previously.</p>

	<br>
		<h2>Website 3: Typography Hover Effect</h2>
					<a href="https://www.vincentsaisset.com/">Website 3</a>
	<br>
		<p>Under the Typography Inspiration collection on awwwards.com I found another
			hovering effect that would change the fill of the word from empty (white) to full
			(black) which not only makes for good contrast but also reinforces what link you are
			about to view. This is helpful because it distinguishes each category from the other as
			they all appear to be similar in the same css style. I sound repetitive at this point in time,
			but my best guess would be that this is another css function with hovering text where a word
			is filled when scrolled over. My only question was why the creator did this only with the last word
			and not both as each line has two.</p>

		<h2>Summary of Efforts:</h2>
			<p>Overall I found this lab to be engaging and I feel inspired to be more creative
		 	with my experimentation in future assignments. There are endless features UX/UI
		 	has to offer, and with advanced coding I hope we will be able to try the different
		 	areas we have witnessed through these websites. I looked at websites from the
		 	categories of filters and effects, storytelling, minimal, fashion websites,
		 	creative portfolios, and typography inspiration and chose three based on unique
		 	features of navigational scrolling, transitional typography, and scrolling effects.
		 	For the Atom/Github portion of the assignment after finding our websites, it was a bit
		 	hazy trying to remember how to correctly code html as well as implement css but looking
		 	back at CST 251 assignments helped me jumpstart back into what we already know; I did not
		 	have difficulty or encounter any challenges during this lab.</p>
