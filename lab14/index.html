	<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
	<div id="chall">
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to repeat the example loop that we did in class
		with else if statements. Following the lecture example, we were left with a
		function that checks if the numbers between 1-200 are factors of 3, 5, 7
		and their combinations through Fizz Buzz Boom.</p>
	</div>
<br>
	<div id="prob">
	<h1> Problems</h1>
		<p>I incorrectly read the assignment and thought we would be using the same
		code from our practice on jsfiddle in class. After asking my peers questions,
		they guided me to the correct coding, as well as the Console giving me my syntax
		errors (incorrect spelling, wrong bracket, div misplacement, not adding indents).
		I did not add a click button, just created them as a list.</p>
</div>

	<div id="result">
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>If you scroll down my page, you will see my results! There is a list of
			numbers through 200 replaced by their assigned name.</p>
