    <h1>Lab 15: Basic Debugging</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to revisit our past lab assignments and
		debug any that are not working properly with our newfound debugging knowledge.
		</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>I encountered no problems with lab 13, but with lab 14</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>Out of my 14 past labs, only 2 had problems. Below will be my screenshots
		showcasing my code and the website appearence itself.</p>

		<h2>Lab 13</h2>
		<p>My lab 13 had slight problems
		in the css where breaks needed to be inserted, and as for coding there was a
		missing semicolon at the end of a variable. I had changed my theme to Bratz
		dolls, and in the process misplaced the semicolon.</p>
