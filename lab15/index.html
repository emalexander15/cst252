    <h1>Lab 15: Basic Debugging</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to revisit our past lab assignments and
		debug any that are not working properly with our newfound debugging knowledge.
		</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>I encountered no problems with lab 13, but with lab 14 I spent about 3
		hours trying to fix all of my errors. Below you will find my reasoning.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>Out of my 14 past labs, only 2 had problems. Below will be my screenshots
		showcasing my code and the website appearence itself.</p>
  <br>

	<br>
		<h2>Lab 13</h2>
		<p>My lab 13 had slight problems in the css where breaks needed to be inserted,
		and as for coding there was a missing semicolon at the end of a variable. I
		had changed my theme to Bratz dolls, and in the process misplaced the
		semicolon.</p>

		<h2>Lab 14</h2>
		<p>My lab 14 I did incorrectly. I read the assignment and thought we would be using
		the exact coding from our practice on jsfiddle in class. After asking my peers
		questions, they guided me to the correct coding with else if statements,
		and the Console giving me many syntax errors afterwards including incorrect spelling
		and capitalization in	getElementById, wrong bracket in doing ] not }, div
		misplacement, and not adding indents as Wes warned m prior in class. I did
		not add a click button, just created them as a list. </p>
