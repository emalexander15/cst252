    <h1>Lab 15: Basic Debugging</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to revisit our past lab assignments and
		debug any that are not working properly with our newfound debugging knowledge.
		</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>I encountered no problems with lab 13, but with lab 14 I spent about 3
		hours trying to fix all of my errors to end up finding out I needed to make
		a button and fix the output.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>Out of my 14 past labs, only 2 had problems. Below will be my screenshots
		showcasing my code and the website appearence itself.</p>

		<h2>Lab 13</h2>
		<p>My lab 13 had slight problems in the css where breaks needed to be inserted,
		and as for coding there was a missing semicolon at the end of a variable. I
		had changed my theme to Bratz dolls, and in the process misplaced the
		semicolon.</p>

		<h2>Lab 14</h2>
		<p>This lab was an absolute pain. Turns out the whole time I was doing it
		wrong, I thought it would print from the output but then looked at peer's
	  and saw it was through a button. Aside from this moronic mistake, I was
		putting the output Str in the wrong place (below the if/ outputStr itself)
		and not at the bottom. The console gave me multiple syntax errors with the
		parantheses and curly brackets and at first was unsure why then figured it
		out that it was in the wrong place entirely. Even after this, I was still
		stumped so reached out to a friend for help since my partner was also
		confused and she was unable at the time.</p>
