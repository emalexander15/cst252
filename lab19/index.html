    <h1>Lab 19: AJAX</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to experiment with jQuery, AJAX, and APIs.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>I ran into countless problems. I was trying to figure out why the
		API I inputted (url) would not load information on my page when it still said
		"success" when clicking the button. I looked into different methods, went on
	  RapidAPI and signed up, and looked at the creator's notes. It may have
		to do with a code, but I selected the free use one and even used the code
		suggested. After speaking to Wes, I now understand I needed a separate stringify
	  for JSON since it was formatted through there and not plain text.</p>
