		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The main idea of this lab was to download and locate our local file structure
		for our cst252 directory. We also added index.html files to our parent folders as
		well as further stylized our homepage through creating a site.css and adding links
		to each of our individual labs so they can be accessed in one place.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><u>Problems</u></h1>
		<p>I did not encounter any challenges during this lab. I am an organized individual
		by nature, so file structuring has always come easy to me. I remembered how to create
		new .html filed from cst251 so this portion of the lab also came back to me.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><u>Results</u></h1>
		<p>You're looking at my results! Below is a screenshot of my cst252 file structure on
		my local machine.</p>
