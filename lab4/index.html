		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p><center>The main idea of this lab was to think of examples of an everyday task
		an individual may not be familiar with such as a recipe for making food as well as
		a computer task. After separating these tasks into two outlined lists, we then began
		making comments on our lab JavaScript files. Ultimately, we did so in order to
		begin thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</center></p>
		<br>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p><center>During this lab the only problem I encountered was pasting my comments from
			my Js file into my html. I had not used the pre and code tags outlined in our lesson
			which was my mistake. I also am confused on whether or not we need to link our Js files
			yet since there is technically no code that has been inserted, just comments. I now see
			that the tags not only keep the code in the correct indentation but also in a different
			font which helps to visually separate it from the rest of the body text.</center></p>
		<br>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p><center>Below will be task 1-3 of an <b>everyday task</b>, <b>computer task</b>, and the
		<b>pseudocode comments</b> from Js.</center></p>
		<br>
			<h2>Task 1: Pseudocode an Everyday Task</h2>

				4. Check that your file is a png with no background<br>
				5. Drag the png you would like to change it to to your desktop and choose Edit
				> Copy<br>
				6. Click the designated folder on your desktop you would like to change from
				Apple's given blue folder icon to the icon of your choice<br>
				7. Right click the folder and select File > Get Info<br>
				8. Once on the file preview, click the small icon in the top left corner and
				choose Edit > Paste<br>
				9. Repeat steps if you would like to do it more than once<br>
