	<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
	<p>The goal of this lab was to experiment with basic JavaScript data types
		and variables through the console on Google Chrome inspect. After we
		experimented here, we translated our code on to Atom in a Js file which
		we then implemented in our lab index. The subject of the lab was the
		make, model, color, and age of our vehicle.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>The only problem I encountered in this lab was my Js file appearing on
			my lab 5 index. The issue was capitalization in my coding. I am unsure how
			'years' is supposed to appear after the age as well.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>You are looking at my results! Below will be the program execution.</p>
