	<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<p>The goal of this lab was to experiment again with JavaScript, but this
		 time with arrays and objects. We used the variables myTransport
	   and myMainRide to distinguish how we get around to places.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>The problems I encountered in this lab was remembering the difference
			 between the brackets {} and []. I am a bit lost amongst arrays and
		 	 objects so will be reviewing the lectures and slideshows. I also am
		 	 unable to get myMainRide variable to show on my index.html.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>You are looking at my results! Below will be the program execution.</p>
