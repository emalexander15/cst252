    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to write functions that take user input
		and manipulate a string in order to get names from the user's input.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>The problems I encountered included missing steps to get the finalized
		random name as well as format it properly. I originally just created a
		variable for sortUserName, nameArray, and nameSorted so only the pop up
	 	window in the beginning would show up. After reviewing Wes' coding I
		realized I needed more variables as well as missed and needed to delete
		some spacebars in formatting, and the main () at the bottom. I was unable
		to figure out task x with the new name and cspital letters, although I did
		look at Wes' coding I did not want to simply copy it but rather understand
		and do it myself.</p>
