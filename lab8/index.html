    <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and
			callbacks with an array of numbers and the new function 'map'. We did
			this through the Google Chrome console then added our code from the
			console experiment into the lab JS file and lastly into our html.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>The problems I encountered included the console being unable to define my
			 anonymous results in a repetitive "array is not defined" and correctly
			 transferring my code from my console into my Js file on Atom.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>You are looking at my results! Below will be the program execution.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div id="results">
			<p><b>Original array:</b> [3, 21, 45, 67, 82, 10]</p>
			<p><b>Adding 15 to array:</b> [18, 36, 60, 82, 97, 116]</p>
			<p><b>Multiplying .05 to array:</b> [0.15000000000000002, 1.05, 2.25, 3.35,
				4.1000000000000005, 5.050000000000001]</p>
