    <h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment modifying the DOM and create
			button elements with stylistic properities assigned to different variables.
		</p>
  <br>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>The problems I encountered in this lab were minimal mistakes in my
		   coding's spelling as well as forgetting a semicolon after one of the
		 	 lines. The lecture was helpful in laying out the steps to make a new
		 	 element and change it's css attributes. It was a bit tricky at first
		   because the css is labeled differently in css and js, but I am getting
		 	 the hang of it. I am a bit confused on how it is supposed to be a button,
		 	 I assume it has to have a link in order to click it or it appear as an
		 	 imagery of a button.</p>
